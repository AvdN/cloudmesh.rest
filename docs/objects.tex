%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Design by Example}

To accelereat discussion among the team we use an approach to define
objects and its interfaces by  example. These examples are than taken
in a later version of the document and a schema is generated from
it. The schema will be added in its complete form to the
appendix. While focusing first on examples it allows us to speed up
our design and simplifies discussions of the objects and interfaces
eliminating getting lost in complex syntactical specifications. The
process and specifications used in this document will also allow us to
automatically create a implementation of the objects that can be
integrated into a reference architecture as provided by for example
the cloudmesh client and rest project \cite{??}.  

An example object will demonstrate our approach. The following object
defines a JSON object representing a user. 

\begin{json}
"user":{  
     "firstname": "Gregor",  
     "lastname": "von Laszewski",  
     "email": "laszewski@gmail.com",  
     "username": "gregor" 
}
\end{json}


\begin{Verbatim}
"user":{  
     "firstname": "Gregor",  
     "lastname": "von Laszewski",  
     "email": "laszewski@gmail.com",  
     "username": "gregor" 
}
\end{Verbatim}
 
Such an object can be transformed to a more precise specification as a
schema while introspecting the types resulting in  

\begin{Verbatim}
user = {  
   ’firstname’: { ’type’: ’string’},  
   ’lastname’: { ’type’: ’string’ },   
   ’email’: { ’type’: ’email’ },  
   ’username’: { ’type’: ‘string’ } 
}  
\end{Verbatim}

The appendix will list the examples as well as the schema definitions
(see appendix ???).

\subsection{Interface Compliancy}

Due to the extensibility of our interfaces it is important to
introduce a terminology that allows us to define interface
compliancy. We define it as follows

\begin{description}

\item[Full Compliance:] These are reference implementations that
  provide full compliance to the objects defined in this document. A
  version number will be added to assure the snapshot in time of the
  objects is associated with the version. This reference
  implementation will implement all objects.

\item[Partially Compliance:] These are reference implementations that
  provide partial compliance to the objects defined in this
  document. A version number will be added to assure the snapshot in
  time of the objects is associated with the version. This reference
  implementation will implement a partial list of the objects. A
  document is accompanied that lists all objects defined, but also
  lists the objects that are not defined by the reference
  architecture.

\item[Full and extended Compliance:] These are interfaces that in
  addition to the full compliance also introduce additional interfaces
  and extend them.

\section{Data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Data for Big Data applications are delivered through data
providers. They can be either local providers contributed by a user or
distributed data providers that refer to data on the internet. At this
time we focus on an elementary set of abstractions related to data
providers that offer us to utilize variables, files, virtual data
directories, data streams, and data filters.

\begin{description}
\item[Files] are used to represent information collected within the context
of classical files in an operating system. 

\item[Streams] are services that offer the consumer a stream of data. Streams may allow the initiation of filters to reduce the amount of data requested by the consumer 
Stream Filters operate in streams or on files converting them to streams 

\item[Batch Filters] operate on streams and on files while working in
  the background and delivering as output Files 

\item[Virtual directories] and non-virtual directories are collection
  of files that organize them. For our initial purpose the distinction
  between virtual and non-virtual directories is non-essential and we
  will focus on abstracting all directories to be virtual. This could
  mean that the files are physically hosted on different
  disks. However, it is important to note that virtual data
  directories can hold more than files, they can also contain data
  streams and data filters.

\subsection{File}

A file is a computer resource allowing to store data that is being
processed. The interface to a file provides the mechanism to
appropriately locate a file in a distributed system. Identification
include the name, and andpoint, the checksum and the size. Additional
parameters such as the lasst access time could be stored also. As such
the Interface only describes the location of the file 

The \textbf{file} object has \textit{name}, \textit{endpoint} (location), \textit{size}
in GB, MB, Byte, \textit{checksum} for integrity check, and last
\textit{accessed} timestamp. 

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/file.json}{file}{s:file}

\subsection{File Alias}

A file could have one alias or even multiple ones.

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/file_alias.json}{file alias}{s:file-alias}

\subsection{Replica}

In many distributed systems, it is of importance that a file can be
replicated among different systems in order to provide faster
access. It is important to provide a mechanism that allows to trace
the pedigree of the file while pointing to its original source 

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/replica.json}{replica}{s:replica}


\subsection{Virtual Directory}

A collection of files or replicas. A virtual directory can contain an
number of entities cincluding files, streams, and other virtual
directories as part of a collection. The element in the collection can
either be defined by uuid or by name.

\subsection{Database}

A \textbf{database} could have a name, an \textit{endpoint} (e.g., host:port),
and protocol used (e.g., SQL, mongo, etc.).

\section{Virtual Cluster}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Cluster}

The cluster object has name, label, endpoint and provider. The
\textit{endpoint} defines....  The \textit{provider} defines the
nature of the cluster, e.g., its a virtual cluster on an openstack
cloud, or from AWS, or a bare-metal cluster.


\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/cluster.json}{cluster}{s:cluster}
\
\subsection{Compute Resource}

An important concept for big data analysis it the representation of a
compute resource on which we execute the analysis. We define a compute
resource by name and by endpoint. A compute resource is an abstract
concept and can be instantiated through virtual machines, containers,
or bare metal resources. This is defined by the “kind” of the compute
resource 

\textbf{compute\_resource} object has attribute \textit{endpoint} which
specifies ... The \textit{kind} could be \textit{baremetal} or \textit{VC}.

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/compute_resource.json}{compute resource}{s:compute-resource}

\subsection{Computer}

This defines a \textbf{computer} object. A computer has name, label,
IP address. It also listed the relevant specs such as memory, disk
size, etc.

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/computer.json}{computer}{s:computer}


\subsection{node}

A node is composed of multiple components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Metadata such as the \verb|name| or \verb|owner|.
\item Physical properties such as \verb|cores| or \verb|memory|.
\item Configuration guidance such as \verb|create_external_ip|,
  \verb|security_groups|, or \verb|users|.
\end{enumerate}

The metadata is associated with the node on the provider end (if
supported) as well as in the database. Certain parts of the metadata
(such as \verb|owner|) can be used to implement access
control. Physical properties are relevant for the initial allocation
of the node. Other configuration parameters control and further
provisioning.

In the above, after allocation, the node is configured with a user
called \verb|hello| who is part of the \verb|wheel| group whose
account can be accessed with several SSH identities whose public keys
are provided (in \verb|authorized_keys|).

Additionally, three ssh keys are generated on the node for the
\verb|hello| user. The first uses the \verb|ed25519| cryptographic
method with a password read in from a GPG-encrypted file on the
Command and Control node. The second is a 4098-bit RSA key also
password-protected from the GPG-encrypted file. The third key is
copied to the remote node from an encrypted file on the Command and
Control node.

This definition also provides a security group to control access to
the node from the wide-area-network. In this case all ingress and
egress TCP and UDP traffic is allowed provided they are to ports 22
(SSH), 443 (SSL), and 80 and 8080 (web).

\subsection{Virtual Cluster}

A virtual cluster is an agglomeration of virtual compute nodes that
constitute the cluster. Nodes can be assembled to be baremetal,
virtual machines, and containers. A virtual cluster contains a number
of virtual compute nodes.

\subsection{Virtual Machine}

Virtual Machine 
Virtual machines are an emulation of a computer system. We are maintaining a very basic set of information. It is expected that through the endpoint the virtual machine can be introspected and more detailed information can be retrieved.

\subsection{Deployment}

A \textbf{deployment} consists of the resource \- \textit{cluster},
the location \- \textit{provider}, e.g., AWS, OpenStack, etc., and
software \textit{stack} to be deployed (e.g., hadoop, spark).

the \textit{parameters} of the deployment, and the system packages as
\textit{requires}. For each requirement, it could have attributes such
as the library origin, version, etc.

\section{Using the Cloudmesh REST Service} 

Components are written as YAML markup in files in the
\verb+resources/samples+ directory.

For example:

\codeFromFile{json}{../cloudmesh/specification/examples/profile.json}{profile}{s:profile}

\subsection{Element Definition}

Each resource should have a \verb+description+ entry to act as
documentation. The documentation should be formated as
reStructuredText. For example:

\subsection{Yaml}

\begin{Verbatim}
entry = yaml.read('''
profile:
  description: |
    A user profile that specifies general information 
    about the user
  email: laszewski@gmail.com, required
  firtsname: Gregor, required
  lastname: von Laszewski, required
  height: 180
'''}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Cerberus}

\begin{Verbatim}
schema = {
'profile': {
  'description': {'type': 'string'}
  'email':       {'type': 'string', 'required': True}
  'firtsname':   {'type': 'string', 'required': True}
  'lastname':    {'type': 'string', 'required': True}
  'height':      {'type': 'float'}
}
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Mongoengine}

\begin{Verbatim}
class profile(Document):
    description = StringField()
    email = EmailField(required=True)
    firstname = StringField(required=True)
    lastname = StringField(required=True)
    height = FloatField(max_length=50)
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Cloudmesh Notation}

\begin{Verbatim}
profile:
    description: string
    email: email, required
    firstname: string, required
    lastname: string, required
    height: flat, max=10
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{Verbatim}
proposed command

cms schema FILENAME --format=mongo -o OUTPUT
cms schema FILENAME --format=cerberus -o OUTPUT
cms schema FILENAME --format=yaml -o OUTPUT

  reads FILENAME in cloudmesh notation and returns format


cms schema FILENAME --input=evegenie -o OUTPUT
   reads eavegene example and create settings for eve
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Defining Elements for the REST Service}

To manage a large number of elements defined in our REST service
easily, we manage them trhough definitions in yaml files. To generate
the appropriate settings file for the rest service, we can use teh
following command:

\begin{verbatim}
cms admin elements <directory> <out.json>
\end{verbatim}

where

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+<directory>+: directory where the YAML definitions reside
\item \verb+<out.json>+: path to the combined definition
\end{itemize}

For example, to generate a file called all.json that integrates all
yml objects defined in the directory \verb+resources/samples+ you can
use the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
cms elements resources/samples all.json
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{DOIT}


cms schema spec2tex resources/specification resources/tex

\subsection{Generating service}

With evegenie installed, the generated JSON file from the above step
is processed to create the stub REST service definitions.
