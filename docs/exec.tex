\section*{Executive Summary}

The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework: Volume 8, ??
document was prepared by the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Interface Subgroup to gather use cases and extract requirements. The Subgroup developed interfaces to the Nist Big Data Refernce Architecture. The interafces contain two differnt concepts:

\begin{itemize}

\item the definition of resources that are part of the NBDRA. These resources are formulated in Json format and can be integrated into a REST framework or an object based framework easily.

\item the definition of simple interface use cases that allow us to illustrate the usefulness of the resources defined. 

\end{itemize} 

We categorized the resources in groups that are identified by the NBDRA set forward in volume 8. While volume 3 provides application oriented high level use cases the usecases defined in this document are subsets of them and focus on the use of the interface. They are not meant to be complete examples, but showcase why the resource has been defined.




The use interfaces are, of course, only representative, and do not represent the entire spectrum of Big Data
usage. All of the interfaces were openly discussed in the working group. Additions are welcome and we like to dicuss your contributions in the group.

The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework consists of seven volumes, each of which addresses a
specific key topic, resulting from the work of the NBD-PWG. The eight volumes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Volume 1, Definitions
\item Volume 2, Taxonomies
\item Volume 3, Use Cases and General Requirements
\item Volume 4, Security and Privacy
\item Volume 5, Architectures White Paper Survey
\item Volume 6, Reference Architecture
\item Volume 7, Standards Roadmap
\item Volume 8, Interfaces
\end{itemize}

The NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework will be released in three versions, which correspond to
the three development stages of the NBD-PWG work. The three stages aim to achieve the following with
respect to the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).

\begin{itemize}
\item Stage 1: Identify the high-level Big Data reference architecture key components, which are
technology-, infrastructure-, and vendor-agnostic.
\item Stage 2: Define general interfaces between the NBDRA components.
\item Stage 3: Validate the NBDRA by building Big Data general applications through the general
interfaces.
\end{itemize}

This document is targeting Stage 2 of the NBDRA. However currently it supports already Stage 1
