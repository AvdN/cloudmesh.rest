A \textbf{virtual\_machine} in a cloud environment has attributes such as
\textit{flavor} (size), \textit{image} (from which the node is instantiated),
IP addresses (could have multiple ones), \textit{status} to indicated if
the VM is running/suspended/shutoff, and other metadata associated with
it (e.g., which group/experiment the VM is part of, etc.).
